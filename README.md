Known bugs:
- The `MutationObserver` gets more data than it should, that retriggers unnecessary redraws at the `Overlay`
- Translation is being called more than once. We should restrict those calls
- Sometimes a standard subtitle from streaming service slips in
- Kill subtitles from `Overlay` when they are removed from streaming subtitle
- Deal with subtitle deactivation on streaming service (`observer.disconnect()` ?)

Todo:
- Create small interface and icon
- Add icon animation for loading (replacing the error message of `MutationObserver`)
- Setup CI/CD
- Setup publishing
- Add tests
- Add ESLint
- Add support to full screen Netflix

Future:
- Add support to other streaming services
